Weather app using JS and free API.

The project opens as a simple html page with a box containing an input and a search button for you to search the weather of the city you like.

The api key and url work together to load the particular city you have searched for in the input.

The background of the page changes according to the weather of the searched city 

```
For example:
City = London
Weather = CLoudy
The background uses a cloudy gif to show the weather.
```

Used a free API from OpenWeather API which displays location using your personal API key.
